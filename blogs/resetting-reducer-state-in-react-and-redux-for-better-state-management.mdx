# Resetting Reducer State in React and Redux for Better State Management
**Introduction:**
In React and Redux applications, managing state efficiently is crucial for optimal performance. One common issue developers face is the persistence of reducer state in useSelector hooks, causing unnecessary re-renders even when actions are not called. In this article, we'll explore the importance of resetting the reducer state and how to implement it in your application.

**Section 1: Understanding the Problem**
The useSelector hook is a powerful tool in Redux that allows components to access the Redux store's state. However, when the reducer state is not reset, useSelector can cause unnecessary re-renders, impacting performance.
Consider the following example:
```javascript
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import {useState,useEffect} from "react";
import {addUser} from "../actions";

function Page(){
const dispatch = useDispatch()
const user = useSelector((state) => state.user);
const addUser = useSelector((state) => state.addUser);
//setting a snackbar for user to see the response on adding the new user
const [snackBarIsOpen, setSnackBarIsOpen]=useState(false);
const [snackMsg, setSnackBarMsg] = useState("");
const [usersData, setUsersData] = useState([]);
useEffect(() => {
  if (user.response) {
    setUserData(user.response.data)
  }
}, [user]);
useEffect(() => {
  if (addUser.response) {
    setSnackBarIsOpen(true)
    setSnackBarMsg(addUser.response.message)
  }
 if (addUser.error) {
    setSnackBarIsOpen(true)
    setSnackBarMsg(addUser.error.data.message)
  }
}, [addUser]);

function addUserButton(name){
   dispatch(addUser(name))       //dispatching the action
}

/*
//remaining code
*/

```
In the above example, we are retrieving a user list from reducers and rendering it on a Page along with an 'Add' button to add a user. If it is a new user, it will be added to the list with the message `User added successfully`.However, if it is a duplicate user, an error message `Duplicate user not allowed` will be displayed. In this scenario, a snackbar is used to show the messages. Additionally, we are considering the use of redux-persist to maintain the viewer's logged-in state.

The problem arises when a user is being added (let's consider a successful entry). The snackbar displays the success message retrieved from the useSelector hook. However, if the page is re-rendered, the snackbar still shows the message, even if the user has not been added.

**Section 2: Resetting Reducer State**
To prevent unnecessary re-renders, we can reset the reducer state after performing actions like delete, edit, or create. This ensures that the useSelector hook only triggers re-renders when relevant actions are called.

**Section 3: Implementing Reset Actions**
First let's create a reset state in reducer:

```javascript

export const addUserReducer = (state = {}, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "addUser-api-request":
      return { loading: true }
    case "addUser-api-success":
      return { loading: false, response: action.payload }
    case "addUser-api-fail":
      return { loading: false, error: action.payload }
    case "addUser-api-reset": //added new case returning empty object
      return {}                 
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

```
Now, dispatch the reset action in our ui page

```javascript
///rest of code 
<Snackbar
  anchorOrigin={{ "bottom", "left" }}
  open={snackBarIsOpen}
  autoHideDuration={3000}
  onClose={()=>{setSnackBarIsOpen(false);dispatch({type:'addUser-api-reset'})}}
  message={snackMsg}
/> 
</>
)}
export default Page;
```

Now, whenever the Snackbar is active and closes after 3 seconds, it will also empty the object in the `addUser` reducer, effectively resetting the state. You can also reset all states at once, but if it is only necessary to reset one state, this is the recommended approach.

**Conclusion:**
Resetting the reducer state in React and Redux applications is essential for efficient state management and preventing unnecessary re-renders. By implementing reset actions and handling them in your reducers, you can improve your application's performance and ensure a smoother user experience. Give this technique a try in your projects and see the difference it makes!
